name: AWSOldBootImagesLackAfterburn
message: |-
  4.1 AWS boot images are not compatible with some 4.11 and later, and machines created with them will fail to become nodes.  This risk does not apply if a cluster is not on AWS, was installed as version 4.2 or later, or otherwise uses 4.2 or later boot images.
