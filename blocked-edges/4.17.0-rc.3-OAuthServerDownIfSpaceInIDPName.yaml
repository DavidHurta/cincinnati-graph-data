name: OAuthServerDownIfSpaceInIDPName
message: |-
  The OAuth server may crash-loop if either of the following conditions is met:

  * At least two password-based IDPs have been configured in the OAuth configuration custom resource, and one of them contains a white space in its name. If the "kube:admin" user has not been removed from a cluster, then this already counts as an IDP. Currently, the supported password-based IDPs are HTPasswd, Keystone, LDAP, and BasicAuth.

  * At least one OAuth IDP with a white space in its name has been configured. Currently, the supported OAuth IDPs are OpenID, GitHub, GitLab and Google.
